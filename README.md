### Play the classic game in which 2 players each compete to memorize and claim more card pairs than the other!

Click on a card to select it. When two cards are selected, the game will check if they are a matching pair. If they are, the player who selected them will win a point for the pair. If not, the cards will flip back over, and it is the next player's turn to go. Repeat until all cards have been matched with their pair, at which point the player with the most points wins.

Click on "Sets" in the main menu to play with different cards! (currently only 2 sets available)
